# Connectors

This directory includes skeletons and examples for exchange connectors:

- `fix/` — Node-based FIX acceptor skeleton (uses `fixparser` for testing and incoming sessions).
- `ouch_itch/` — Rust skeleton for OUCH/ITCH low-latency adapters (performance oriented).

These are skeletons to integrate with matching engine. Implementations should be hardened for production.
